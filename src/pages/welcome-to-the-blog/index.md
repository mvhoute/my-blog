Hi there. This is my blog. There are many, many, MANY blogs, but this one is mine. Let me tell you what you can expect on my little corner on the web!

<!-- end -->

## Small introduction
My name is Martin, I'm from Gouda - the Netherlands, I'm married with children, and basically: I'm a nerd. In my daily life I'm a frontend developer at [Aviva Solutions](https://avivasolutions.nl), where I work on various projects. 

I have many hobbies: I enjoy music, photography, art & design, reading books and watching football (or soccer if you're from the US). Oh yeah, and blogging! 

## Why this blog?
I always had an interest in writing, however I didn't really know what stories I would like to tell to the world, or I simply didn't have the time or inspiration / motivation to do it. 

I enjoy reading blogs / articles from other frontend developers, and try to learn from them. However, since I'm getting more and more experienced in my field of work, I feel the 'urge' to share my knowledge with others. 

Besides frontend development, I'd also like to write about other stuff that interest me, or things that keeps me up at night. (Don't worry, I get plenty of sleep). 

## Questions? Suggestions?
